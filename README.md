If you're here, it's likely because you came from *Redux-First Router* repo. The best docs still exist [in the React Native section](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router/blob/master/docs/react-native.md#first-class-react-navigation-support) of the main repo.

The messy boilerplate mentioned there is at:
